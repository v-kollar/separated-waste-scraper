2023-04-20 20:11:15+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Initializing database files


PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:

'/usr/bin/mariadb-secure-installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.
